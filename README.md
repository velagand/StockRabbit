Analyze past events to understand the future

## Inspiration
Whenever attempting to analyze and gain insights from major news events that affect stock performance, it can be difficult to understand what effect that event had on a certain company. Often, websites such as Google Finance will simply provide a list of news articles for the user to filter through, but no mechanism for comprehending the effects of these events.
